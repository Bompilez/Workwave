# Workwave
Description
This project is a website designed to help users relax or focus while working. The site combines lofi music with a minimalist design and a timer function to create a calming and productive atmosphere. The goal of this site is to provide users with a simple yet effective platform where they can listen to music, set work intervals, and create a custom "lofi mood" for work or relaxation.
